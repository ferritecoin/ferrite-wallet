### Before updating, remember to **back up your wallet!**

## Ferrite Wallet for Android
Ferrite Wallet is designed for self-custody of ferritecoins on Android mobile devices. 
Built on the foundation of [Schildbach Wallet 6.41](https://github.com/bitcoin-wallet/bitcoin-wallet/tree/v6.41), this lightweight wallet offers full support for Android 4.4 KitKat and above.

This wallet has been tested up to Android 14 Upside Down Cake.

## Key Features

- Mobile Wallet - Carry your Ferritecoins with you wherever you go, right in your pocket. 
- Simple payments - Make payments by simply scanning a QR code, and as a merchant, you can accept payments instantly and with confidence. This wallet implements Simplified Payment Verification (SPV), following the principles outlined in the Bitcoin whitepaper.
- Self-custodial - No user registration, web service, or cloud storage is needed. You hold full control of your coins — remember, if you don’t have the keys, you don’t own the coins. Be sure to back up your wallet! 
- Seamless transactions - Supports QR codes, URLs, and NFC for easy transactions. Even when you're offline, you can still make payments through Bluetooth. 
- Global - Offers multi-language support. 

## Note
    Currently, only legacy Ferritecoin addresses (starting with 'F') are supported.
    Balance may show zero if rescanning or if blockchain is not fully synchronised.
